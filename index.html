        <ul>
          <li>Hypertext Markup Language</li>
          <li>An element is a type of content on a webpage</li>
          <li>Elements are also used to divide the content on the page and to describe the content to browsers and other developers</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>Declarations are not case sensitive</li>
          <li>An HTML attribute defines additional information about an element</li>
          <li>HTML attributes are always defined in the begining element</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
     <ul>
       <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
       <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
       <li>CSS Box Model - Every HTML element is essentially a box - Margin, Border, Padding, Content</li>
       <li>An Inline CSS is used when a developer wants to style an element directly in the HTML file.</li>
       <li>Internal Style Sheet contains rules for the webpage in the Head section of the HTML file</li>
       <li>External Style Sheet is the most commonly used. It allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a seperate file, making changes easier</li>
       <li>External Style Sheets are an example of the "Seperation of Concerns" - the practice of seperating code into different files based on use</li>

     <ul>
       <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
       <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
       <li>Every git repository starts with a default Branch called "Main" which holds the final product</li>
       <li>Multiple branches can exist at a single time, serving different purposes</li>
       <li>A Feature Branch might hold code that is being developed for a single feature of the application. A working branch</li>
       <li>A Develop Branch might hold code for multiple feature branches that haven't been incorporated into the main branch yet</li>
       <li>Branches don't affect the Main branch until Approved, Tested, and Merged</li>
       <li>A Pull Request (PR) is used to merge a comparison branch into Main</li>

      <li>A value can either be Truthy or Falsy</li>
      <li>An Array is a single variable used to group related data, typically data that is related in the same way</li>
      <li>Arrays are zero-indexed and sequential. The first item is always 0</li>
      <li>A For loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over</li>
      <li>A Function is simply a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task</li>
